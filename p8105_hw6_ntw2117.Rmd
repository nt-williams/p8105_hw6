library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
```

### Problem One

*importing and manipulating data* 

```{r importing and manipulating wp data}
murder <- 
  read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")

murder <- murder %>%  
  unite("city_state", c("city", "state"), sep = ", ") %>% 
  mutate(solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0), 
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race != "White", "non-White", "White"), 
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White", "non-White"),
         victim_age = as.double(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(city_state != c("Dallas, TX", "Pheonix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"))
```

*some wee models*

```{r}
balt_model <- murder %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_sex + victim_race + victim_age, family = binomial, data = .)

broom::tidy(balt_model) %>% 
  mutate(or = exp(estimate), 
         or_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error), 
         or_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_racenon-White") %>% 
  select(or, or_lower, or_upper) %>% 
  rename("Odds ratio" = or, 
         "Lower bound" = or_lower, 
         "Upper bound" = or_upper) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
